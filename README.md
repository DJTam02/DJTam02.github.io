Hello! My name is Jacob Tam and this is the repository for my website. Here, you can see all the code that goes into this website including the code used to complete my Graph Traversal Algorithms Visualizer. You can also view what progress I had made on my Mahjong game in the mahjong directory. The main purpose of this website is to showcase my projects and experience with Web Development. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
